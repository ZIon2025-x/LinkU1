# Flutter Environment

Flutter SDK is installed at `F:\flutter\bin\`.

When running Flutter or Dart commands in the Shell tool, always prepend the PATH first:

```powershell
$env:PATH = "F:\flutter\bin;" + $env:PATH; flutter <command>
```

Or call the full path directly:

```powershell
F:\flutter\bin\flutter.bat <command>
```

The Flutter project is located at `link2ur/` subdirectory.
