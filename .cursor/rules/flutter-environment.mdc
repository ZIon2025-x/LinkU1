# Flutter Environment

Flutter SDK is installed at `F:\flutter\bin\`.

All caches are configured on F: drive to avoid cross-drive path issues:
- **PUB_CACHE**: `F:\DevCache\.pub-cache`
- **GRADLE_USER_HOME**: `F:\DevCache\.gradle`
- **Android SDK**: `F:\DevCache\Android\Sdk`

When running Flutter or Dart commands in the Shell tool, always set the environment first:

```powershell
$env:PATH = "F:\flutter\bin;" + $env:PATH; $env:PUB_CACHE = "F:\DevCache\.pub-cache"; $env:GRADLE_USER_HOME = "F:\DevCache\.gradle"; flutter <command>
```

Or call the full path directly:

```powershell
F:\flutter\bin\flutter.bat <command>
```

The Flutter project is located at `link2ur/` subdirectory.
